<h1 style="color:Red">The Story of Little Prince</h1>
<p style="font-family: monospace;font-style: oblique;"><h3>
<br>The narrator, an airplane pilot, crashes in the Sahara desert.<br><br>
The crash badly damages his airplane and leaves the narrator with very little food or water. <br><br>
As he is worrying over his predicament, he is approached by the little prince, <br><br>
a very serious little blond boy who asks the narrator to draw him a sheep. <br><br>
The narrator obliges, and the two become friends. <br><br>
The pilot learns that the little prince comes from a small planet <br><br>
that the little prince calls Asteroid 325 but that people on Earth call Asteroid B-612. <br><br>
The little prince took great care of this planet, preventing any bad seeds from growing <br><br>
and making sure it was never overrun by baobab trees.<br><br>
One day, a mysterious rose sprouted on the planet and the little prince fell in love with it.<br><br>
But when he caught the rose in a lie one day, he decided that he could not trust her anymore.<br><br>
He grew lonely and decided to leave. Despite a last-minute reconciliation with the rose, <br><br>
the prince set out to explore other planets and cure his loneliness.
